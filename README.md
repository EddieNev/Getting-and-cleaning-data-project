For creating a tidy data set using data from: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files in this repo

    1. README.md -- you are reading it right now
    2. CodeBook.md -- codebook describing variables, the data and transformations
    3. run_analysis.R -- R code

The files are used to create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
    5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output is created with the name of tidy.txt
